# BioDrop Design

[BioDrop](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree) (previously known as LinkFree) is a platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a community that has a say in where the project is going.

### I want to suggest a design solution!

Sweet, drop your suggestion on Discord! Please make sure to include the following information:
- Problem statement ‚Äî what is the problem you are trying to solve? Is it linked to any insights? 
- Hypothesis ‚Äî what do you think can help solve this problem?
- Impact & success metrics ‚Äî how are you going to know that you have in fact solved it successfully?
- Dependencies ‚Äî is there anything that need to happen before you can start working on solving this problem?
- Output ‚Äî what is the final output of your work? 
- Timeline: when are you expecting to finish the job by? 

It's important to include all of the above in every design job: without it, we will be distracted by enhancements that have no impact on the product or the users, and waste the time of our engineering contributors.
