# BioDrop Design

Welcome 🤗

We open source the design process to involve our community in the whole process of building BioDrop. Good design is the foundation of every good product and by getting your insights and collaboration onboard, we hope to build a better, more inclusive and accessible product.

## <a id="about">What is BioDrop</a>
[BioDrop](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree) (previously known as LinkFree) is a platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a community that has a say in where the project is going.

### What are we working on?

You can check out all our WIP and backlog items in the Issues tab. Basically, every issue is a design initiative that tackles one problem and achieves one objective. 

### How do I pick a job?

**Unassigned** items are free for a grab: if you see that no one is currently assigned to a feature, feel free to assign it to yourself or ask someone to assign it to you.

### I want to suggest a design solution!

Sweet, go ahead and create an issue! Please make sure to include the following information:
- Problem statement — what is the problem you are trying to solve? Is it linked to any insights? 
- Hypothesis — what do you think can help solve this problem?
- Impact & success metrics — how are you going to know that you have in fact solved it successfully?
- Dependencies — is there anything that need to happen before you can start working on solving this problem?
- Output — what is the final output of your work? 
- Timeline: when are you expecting to finish the job by? 

It's important to include all of the above in every design job: without it, we will be distracted by enhancements that have no impact on the product or the users, and waste the time of our engineering contributors. Also, this will look gorgeous in your portfolio if your project will include all these things, you know 😉

### I don't know how to use GitHub!
You don't have to. Just log in, find an issue that you want to solve, and comment something like: "I'd like to pick it up!", and other team members will be glad to help you.

Aslo, new designers and fresh contributors will have much to learn while working with more senior colleagues, so it's a great chance for you to pick some new things up. Be sure you can deliver!

## <a id="research">Research</a>
We strive to run research continuously, which gives us enough insights into what the users think, but also allowing you as a designer to always have something to contribute. 

If you see that any of the insights are more than 2 months old, feel free to open a new issue and contribute:
- Market analysis;
- UX Audit;
- Stakeholders and users survey/interview;
- Usability testing;
- Any other relevant research.

Make sure to include the objectives of your research and indicate the timeline.
